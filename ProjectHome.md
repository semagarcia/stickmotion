Design and development of a software application for the 3D animation of a simple representation of a human body (stickman).

The animation routines are introduced using a specifically designed language implemented in [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/) (ANother Tool for Language Recognition), an open source framework that can construct interpreters from grammatical descriptions.

This work exemplifies the performance, behaviour and possibilities of ANTLR through the development of a simple but complete programming language.
